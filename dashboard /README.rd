# Process Model Matching Dashboard

## Project Description
This dashboard is an interactive tool built with **Streamlit** for the analysis and visualization of **Process Model Matching (PMM)**.

Its primary goal is to semantically and structurally compare business process models in **BPMN** format, identifying and classifying correspondences between activities (Tasks) according to academic methodology:

- **1:1 (Exact)** – Direct correspondence between single activities.  
- **1:N (Decomposition)** – One activity in model A corresponds to N more granular activities in model B.  
- **N:M (Complex)** – A set of N activities in model A corresponds to a set of M activities in model B (functional alignment).
